Thoughts are forces&mdash;like builds like and like attracts like. Thoughts
of strength both build strength from within and attract it from without.
Thoughts of weakness actualize weakness from within and attract it from
without. Courage begets strength, fear begets weakness. And so courage
begets success, fear begets failure.</p>

is no quality that exerts more good, is of greater service to all
mankind during the course of the ordinary life, than the mind and the
heart that goes out in an all-embracing love for all, that is the
generator and the circulator of a genuine, hearty, wholesome sympathy
and courage and good cheer, that is not disturbed or upset by the
passing occurrence little or great, but that is serene, tranquil, and
conquering to the end, that is looking for the best, that is finding the
best, and that is inspiring the best in all. There is moreover, no
quality that when genuine brings such rich returns to its possessor by
virtue of the thoughts and the feelings that it inspires and calls forth
from others and that come back laden with their peaceful, stimulating,
healthful influences for you.</p>

the night that covers me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Black as the Pit from pole to pole,</span><br />
I thank whatever gods may be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For my unconquerable soul.</span><br />
<br />
In the fell clutch of circumstance<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I have not winced nor cried aloud.</span><br />
Under the bludgeoning of chance<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My head is bloody, but unbowed.</span><br />
<br />
Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Looms but the horror of the shade,</span><br />
And yet the menace of the years<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Finds and shall find me, unafraid.</span><br />
<br />
It matters not how strait the gate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How charged with punishment the scroll,</span><br />
I am the master of my fate;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am the captain of my soul.</span><br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>Thought is the great builder in human life: it is the determining
factor. Continually think thoughts that are good, and your life will
show forth in goodness, and your body in health and beauty. Continually
think evil thoughts, and your life will show forth in evil, and your
body in weakness and repulsiveness. Think thoughts of love, and you will
love and will be loved. Think thoughts of hatred, and you will hate and
will be hated. Each follows its kind.</p>

Every day is a fresh beginning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Every morning is the world made new;</span><br />
You who are weary of sorrow and sinning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here is a beautiful hope for you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A hope for me and a hope for you.</span><br />
<br />
All the past things are past and over,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tasks are done, and the tears are shed.</span><br />
Yesterday's errors let yesterday cover;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yesterday's wounds, which smarted and bled,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are healed with the healing which night has shed.</span><br />
<br />
Every day is a fresh beginning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Listen, my soul, to the glad refrain,</span><br />
And, spite of old sorrow and older sinning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And puzzles forecasted, and possible pain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Take heart with the day and begin again.</span></p>

<hr class="pagebreak" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>Each morning is a fresh beginning. We are, as it were, just beginning
life. We have it <i>entirely</i> in our own hands. And when the morning with
its fresh beginning comes, all yesterdays should be yesterdays, with
which we have nothing to do. Sufficient is it to know that the way we
lived our yesterday has determined for us our today. And, again, when
the morning with its fresh beginning comes, all tomorrows should be
tomorrows, with which we have nothing to do. Sufficient to know that the
way we live our today determines our tomorrow.</p>

<p>Simply the first hour of this new day, with all its richness and glory,
with all its sublime and eternity-determining possibilities, and each
succeeding hour as it comes, but <i>not before</i> it comes&mdash;this is the
secret of character building. This simple method will bring any one to
the realization of the highest life that can be even conceived of, and
there is nothing in this connection that can be conceived of that cannot
be realized somehow, somewhen, somewhere.</p>

The poem hangs on the berry-bush<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When comes the poet's eye,</span><br />
And the whole street is a masquerade<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Shakespeare passes by.</span></p>

<hr class="pagebreak" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>This same Shakespeare, whose mere passing causes all this commotion, is
the one who put into the mouth of one of his creations the words: "The
fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are
underlings." And again he gave us a great truth when he said:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"Our doubts are traitors,</span><br />
And make us lose the good we oft might win<br />
By fearing to attempt."<br />
</p>

<p>There is probably no agent that brings us more undesirable conditions
than fear. We should live in fear of nothing, nor will we when we come
fully to know ourselves. An old French proverb runs:</p>

<p>
"Some of your griefs you have cured,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the sharpest you still have survived;</span><br />
But what torments of pain you endured<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From evils that never arrived."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Fear and lack of faith go hand in hand. The one is born of the other.
Tell me how much one is given to fear, and I will tell you how much he
lacks in faith. Fear is a most expensive guest to entertain, the same as
worry is: so expensive are they that no one can afford to entertain
them. We invite what we fear, the same as, by a different attitude of
mind, we invite and attract the influences and conditions we desire.</p>

<hr class="pagebreak" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>Sweetness of nature, simplicity in manners and conduct, humility without
self-abasement, give the truly kingly quality to men, the queenly to
women, the winning to children, whatever the rank or the station may be.
The life dominated by this characteristic, or rather these closely
allied characteristics, is a natural well-spring of joy to itself and
sheds a continual benediction upon all who come within the scope of its
influence. It makes for a life of great beauty in itself, and it imparts
courage and hope and buoyancy to all others.</p>

There is no thing we cannot overcome;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Say not thy evil instinct is inherited,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or that some trait inborn makes thy whole life forlorn;</span><br />
And calls down punishment that is not merited.<br />
<br />
Back of thy parents and grandparents lies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Great Eternal Will! That too is thine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Inheritance,&mdash;strong, beautiful, divine,</span><br />
Sure lever of success for one who tries.<br />
<br />
Earth has no claim the soul cannot contest;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Know thyself part of the Eternal Source;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Naught can stand before thy spirit's force:</span><br />
The soul's Divine Inheritance is best.</p>

<hr class="pagebreak" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>Thought is at the bottom of all progress or retrogression, of all
success or failure, of all that is desirable or undesirable in human
life. The type of thought we entertain both creates and draws conditions
that crystallize about it, conditions exactly the same in nature as is
the thought that gives them form. Thoughts are forces, and each creates
of its kind, whether we realize it or not. The great law of the drawing
power of the mind, which says that like creates like, and that like
attracts like, is continually working in every human life, for it is one
of the great immutable laws of the universe. For one to take time to see
clearly the things one would attain to, and then to hold that ideal
steadily and continually before his mind, never allowing faith&mdash;his
positive thought-forces&mdash;to give way to or to be neutralized by doubts
and fears, and then to set about doing each day what his hands find to
do, never complaining, but spending the time that he would otherwise
spend in complaint in focusing his thought-forces upon the ideal that
his mind has built, will sooner or later bring about the full
materialization of that for which he sets out.</p>

Beauty seen is never lost,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">God's colors all are fast;</span><br />
The glory of this sunset heaven<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into my soul has passed,&mdash;</span><br />
A sense of gladness unconfined<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To mortal, date or clime;</span><br />
As the soul liveth, it shall live<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beyond the years of time.</span><br />
Beside the mystic asphodels<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall bloom the home-born flowers,</span><br />
And new horizons flush and glow<br />

<p style="margin-left: 7em;"><i>Whittier</i></p>

<hr class="pagebreak" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>Would you remain always young, and would you carry all the joyousness
and buoyancy of youth into your maturer years? Then have care concerning
but one thing,&mdash;how you live in your thought world. It was the inspired
one, Gautama, the Buddha, who said,&mdash;"The mind is everything; what you
think you become." And the same thing had Ruskin in mind when he
said,&mdash;"Make yourselves nests of pleasant thoughts. None of us as yet
know, for none of us have been taught in early youth, what fairy palaces
we may build of beautiful thought&mdash;<i>proof against all adversity</i>." And
would you have in your body all the elasticity, all the strength, all
the beauty of your younger years? Then live these in your mind, making
no room for unclean thought, and you will externalize them in your body.
In the degree that you keep young in thought will you remain young in
body. And you will find that your body will in turn aid your mind, for
body helps mind the same as mind helps body.</p>

There is a sacred Something on all ways&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Something that watches through the Universe;</span><br />
One that remembers, reckons and repays,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Giving us love for love, and curse for curse.</span><br />

<p style="margin-left: 7em;"><i>Edwin Markham</i></p>

<hr class="pagebreak" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>The power of every life, the very life itself, is determined by what it
relates itself to. God is immanent as well as transcendent. He is
creating, working, ruling in the universe today, in your life and in
mine, just as much as He ever has been. We are too apt to regard Him
after the manner of an absentee landlord, one who has set in operation
the forces of this great universe, and then taken Himself away.</p>

<p>In the degree, however, that we recognize Him as immanent as well as
transcendent, are we able to partake of His life and power. For in the
degree that we recognize Him as the Infinite Spirit of Life and Power
that is today, at this very moment, working and manifesting in and
through all, and then, in the degree that we come into the realization
of our oneness with this life, do we become partakers of, and so do we
actualize in ourselves the qualities of his life. In the degree that we
open ourselves to the inflowing tide of this immanent and transcendent
life, do we make ourselves channels through which the Infinite
Intelligence and Power can work.</p>

</p>

<p style="margin-left: 7em;"><i>Edwin Markham</i></p>

<hr class="pagebreak" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>This is the law of prosperity: When apparent adversity comes, be not
cast down by it, but make the best of it, and always look forward for
better things, for conditions more prosperous. To hold yourself in this
attitude of mind is to set into operation subtle, silent, and
irresistible forces that sooner or later will actualize in material form
that which is today merely an idea. But ideas have occult power, and
ideas, when rightly planted and rightly tended, are the seeds that
actualize material conditions.</p>

<p>Never give a moment to complaint, but utilize the time that would
otherwise be spent in this way in looking forward and actualizing the
conditions you desire. Suggest prosperity to yourself. See yourself in a
prosperous condition. Affirm that you will before long be in a
prosperous condition. Affirm it calmly and quietly, but strongly and
confidently. Believe it, believe it absolutely. Expect it,&mdash;keep it
continually watered with expectation. You thus make yourself a magnet to
attract the things that you desire. Don't be afraid to suggest.</p>

<hr class="pagebreak" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>The grander natures and the more thoughtful are always looking for and
in conversation dwelling on the better things in others. It is the rule
with but few, if any exceptions, that the more noble and worthy and
thoughtful the nature, the more it is continually looking for the best
there is to be found in every life. Instead of judging or condemning, or
acquiring the habit that eventually leads to this, it is looking more
closely to and giving its time to living more worthily itself.</p>

<p>It is in this way continually unfolding and expanding in beauty and in
power; it is finding an ever-increasing happiness by the admiration and
the love that such a life is always, even though all unconsciously,
calling to itself from all sources. It is the life that pays by many
fold.</p>

<hr class="pagebreak" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>Many times the struggles are greater than we can ever know. We need more
gentleness and sympathy and compassion in our common human life. Then we
will neither blame nor condemn. Instead of blaming or condemning we will
sympathize.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Comfort one another.</span><br />
For the way is often dreary<br />
And the feet are often weary,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the heart is very sad.</span><br />
There is a heavy burden bearing,<br />
When it seems that none are caring,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we half forget that ever we were glad.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Comfort one another</span><br />
With the hand-clasp close and tender.<br />
With the sweetness love can render,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the looks of friendly eyes.</span><br />
Do not wait with grace unspoken,<br />
While life's daily bread is broken&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gentle speech is oft like manna from the skies."</span><br />

<p>And then when we fully realize the fact that selfishness is at the root
of all error, sin, and crime, and that ignorance is the basis of all
selfishness, with what charity we come to look upon the acts of all. It
is the ignorant man who seeks his own ends at the expense of the greater
whole. It is the ignorant man, therefore, who is the selfish man.</p>

aspirations and a sincere desire for a higher and better condition, so
far as advantages, facilities, associates, or any surroundings or
environments are concerned, and if he continually send out his highest

water these forces with firm expectation as to their fulfillment, he

should be lived. There is no contagion equal to the contagion of life.
Whatever we sow, that shall we also reap, and each thing sown produces
of its kind. We can kill not only by doing another bodily injury
directly, but we can and we do kill by every antagonistic thought. Not
only do we thus kill, but while we kill we suicide. Many a man has been
made sick by having the ill thoughts of a number of people centered upon

make it a literal hell. Put love into the world and heaven with all its
beauties and glories becomes a reality.</p>

<p>Not to love is not to live, or it is to live a living death. The life
that goes out in love to all is the life that is full, and rich, and

becomes ever more inclusive, and hence larger in its scope and

without. Thoughts of weakness actualize weakness from within and attract
it from without. Courage begets strength, fear begets weakness. And so
courage begets success, fear begets failure. It is the man or the woman
of faith, and hence of courage, who is the master of circumstances, and
who make his or her power felt in the world. It is the man or the woman
who lacks faith and who as a consequence is weakened and crippled by
fears and forebodings, who is the creature of all passing occurences.</p>

<p>What one lives in his invisible thought world he is continually
actualizing in his visible material world. If he would have any
conditions different in the latter he must make the necessary change in
the former. A clear realization of this great fact would bring success
to thousands of men and women who all about us are now in the depths of
despair. It would bring health, abounding health and strength to
thousands now diseased and suffering. It would bring peace and joy to
thousands now unhappy and ill at ease.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
