description: New Thought leader Ralph Waldo Trine was an enormously popular figure
  in the metaphysical movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
  His volume In Tune With the Infinite sold millions of copies upon its release in
  1897, a remarkable feat in that era. Thoughts I Met on the Highway is a compendium
  of Trine's follow-up work that serves as a handy and concise introduction to his
  philosophy.
